## Due-date: May 14th, 2021

#### May 2nd, 2021
- Progress:
  - Cleaning data (today)
- Target: 
  - 2-3 days for coding algorithm.
  - 2-3 for the 5-pages summary paper.
- Meeting everyday around 9pm
#### May 3rd, 2021
- Questions:
-   Imporve the scheduling
    - can we departure early? how much earlier? what is the criteria?
    - balancing the inbound and outbound for every 3-4days?
Target:
- draw the graph, how bad/good it is regarding balance.
- how to flat the graph
- 
- Meeting time changed to 8pm

#### May 4th, 2021
- Goal: balance the daily imbalances for the PQ region (= Outbound trailers - Inbound trailers)
- Assumptions:
  - Flexibility for scheduling: 24hrs. Can be parameterized if needed. 
  - Flexibility for trailer class: HEATER/REFFER/etc can be used as DRY if necessary
  - Start Date and Completion Dates are just estimate. If the date is unrealisticly long, we can shorten it (via some mechanism i.e >14 days)
  - Another layer of constraint: Initial number of drivers (~50). Can track along with the cumulative imbalance. Driver from incoming trailers can be factored into our calculation
- A method that figure out how dense our disturibution is.
